Click on each state to find three different metrics of physical distancing: the percent staying completely at home, the median distance traveled by a resident in that state for that day, and the percent commuting to work. Use the slider at the bottom to move the date, viewing how physical distancing increases and decreases throughout the course of the pandemic. Zoom in and out as necessary by scrolling with your mouse.
